# Digital Project Review
### HIST 5152 Reflections Assignment

## About this assignment
By now, you've gained a bit of experience in and understanding of the behind-the-scenes processes of digital history work. Equipped with this knowledge, you now have a chance to critique a project created by someone else. The goal of this review is to provide guidance to potential users and producers of similar digital projects. Your assessment also serves as a contribution to the critical discourse surrounding digital scholarship at large, in an effort to raise the level and quality of work in the field.

### Due date
Due by November 28, 2022.

## Directions
1. Pick one of the ‚Äúfeatured projects‚Äù from this semester, or another digital history/digital humanities project that corresponds to your interests. 
2. Review the project following the guidelines below.
3. Submit your materials.

## Guidelines for the review
Review the project following the guidelines outlined in the Journal of American History and the NCPH Digital History Project Review Guidelines. Your review may take the form of a blog post, a YouTube or video review, a digital exhibit, an oral presentation, etc. or some other type of creative medium (just clear it with me first, please!). The review should be ~500-750 words (if written).

The featured project that I‚Äôm choosing this semester is Data Sonification with TwoTone. Sonification ‚Äúis the practice of mapping aspects of the data to produce sound signals.‚Äù There are certain conditions that must be met in order for a technique to qualify as being sonification. The first condition that must be met is reproducibility. This means that the same sample of data must be able to be transformed by other researchers and produce the same results. The second condition is intelligibility. Intelligibility means that the ‚Äúobjective elements of the original data are reflected systematically in the resulting sound‚Äù (Hermann, 2008).  

 TwoTone is ‚Äúan open source tool to turn data into sound.‚Äù TwoTone allows you to select a sample data source or upload your own data source. The sonification pieces produced in TwoTone allows for both conditions to be met ‚Äì reproducibility and intelligibility. Using TwoTones‚Äô simple platform, users are able to represent their data points sonically.  

Immediately when landing on TwoTone‚Äôs webpage, users are prompted to choose an existing data set or upload their own. Next, users are walked through the different elements on the webpage including what the different icons mean and the various affordances that TwoTone offers. This walk through makes using TwoTone very easy to use. The simple user interface also helps with ease of use. Quite quickly, users are able to being the sonification process of their data sets.  

Sonification is not without its criticisms, often drawing out questions related to the purpose and significance of using sonification. A series of experiments by Last and Usyskin (2015) further interrogated the significance of sonification and aided in explaining the role of using sonification. Their study determined ‚Äúwhat kinds of data-analytic tasks could be performed when the data were sonified.‚Äù According to Last and Usyskin (2015), their results concluded that ‚Äúeven untrained listeners (listeners with no formal training in music) can make useful distinctions in the data.‚Äù Meaning, sonification is a digestible methodology, making understanding data more accessible. Using sonficiation as a data analysis tool, allows for sonified data to be understood in a manner that has previously been overlooked.  

Last and Usyskin (2015) also concluded that ‚Äúlisteners could discriminate the sonified data.‚Äù Common ‚Äúdata exploration tasks such as classification and clustering and the subsequent outputs being mapped‚Äù revealed how the underlying data was heavily reflected by only the Western musical scale. Even with a revelatory methodology for translating data, western dominance was still persistent. Although sonification is a move away from traditional western epistemologies, the dominance of the west (via western musical hierarchies) remains.  

In addressing the criticisms regarding purpose, TwoTone proves that purpose should be broadly understood. Purpose can move beyond a narrowly defined mindset and instead incorporate fun and experimentation. Representation of data does not have to stay within the confines of numerical data sets and pie charts, but can instead be represented in creative manners, such as sonification. Similarly, comprehension of data does not have to be determined by one's ability to understand these numerical data sets verbatim, but instead can be based on one's ability to creatively think, imagine, and create a sonification based on a given data set.
